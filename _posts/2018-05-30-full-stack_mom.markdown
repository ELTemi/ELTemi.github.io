Growing up in Africa, technology often seemed like magic to me; from watching cars zip by, to viewing airplanes at a distance, balancing their weight in the sky. I remember getting my first email address in 2004 and being completely blown away by how I was able to interact with friends who were thousands of miles away with just a few clicks. 

I ended up going to school to study economics because that was my first love, numbers, regressions, supply and demand. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I got 2 Masters in Economics. One in my home country in Nigeria and the other at University College London.

Fast forward to today, I’m a new mom working in the insurance industry; which isn’t entirely boring but I’m quickly realizing that there is often no new knowledge acquired when carrying out my day-to-day responsibilities on the job. This got me thinking; what is the one thing that I am absolutely fascinated about; something that will challenge me in new ways and help me acquire the most sought-after skill in today? Of course, programming! Everything around us requires programming; from cars and airplanes, to web applications.

My first go at programming started with using R and Stata for statistical data analysis. This was super interesting, but not too different from the skills I already acquired studying economics. So, I made the decision to jump in at the deep end by learning web development --- Ruby on Rails to be specific!

When I started researching Ruby on Rails, I was positively surprised by the amount of free resources that was available online. Naturally, I started with some free courses on Udemy and Codecademy, and quickly got hooked! To take my relationship with code to the next level, I started looking for comprehensive programs that not only equipped me with the right skills but will also help position me to land my dream developer job --- that’s when I found Flatiron school. 

It’s been 6 weeks since I joined Flatiron, and I’m happy to report that its all starting to make sense.  I found things a little bit intimidating during my first week on the program; considering my non-engineering background. But the more I interacted with other students, I quickly realized we were all starting from ground zero. I’m definitely more confident in my abilities; every module that I complete brings me a step close to realizing my goal. 

Yes we can!
