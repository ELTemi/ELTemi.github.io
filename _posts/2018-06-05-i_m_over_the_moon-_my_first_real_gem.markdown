Whew! I finally finished my first project. It’s funny because when I look back at when I started 4 weeks ago, I didn’t think it would have been this easy.  First, I had to come up with an idea. This was tough but I finally decided to scrape deals relating to health and fitness from the Living Social website in my area. The HealthFitnessDeals CLI app is a command line application that enables the user to see a list of deals related to health and fitness in the Kitchener-Waterloo area of Canada. The user will then be able to select a deal and view the details of the deal including the title of the deal, the location, the original price and the discounted price.

The first step was to design my executable file, then I built out the CLI application from there. Afterwards, I worked on the deals object, fleshing out the methods necessary to make my executable file work. Then, I built out the scraper object for deals available. Every time a new deal is instantiated, the scraper class scrapes details of the deals based on the url and the user keeps checking out deals until the user decides to exit.  

What worked for me was I ensured that every method I built was working before I moved to the next. It ensures a cleaner and more systematic approach to coding. I was also constantly testing out the CLI and ensuring that at each point, the code wasn’t breaking. When it breaks, I fixed it before moving to the next; not to mention having regular commits and including the details in each commit.

Looking forward to the next project.
